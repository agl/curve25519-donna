This project provides a method to test the performance of Curve25519 on the entire CPU, as opposed to a single thread, approximating the performance of a fully loaded server.

To run:
  make speed-curve25519-donna-c64-threaded && ./speed-curve25519-donna-c64-threaded

Output:
  Will use 5 threads
  Waiting in thread 2 ...
  Waiting in thread 5 ...
  Waiting in thread 3 ...
  Waiting in thread 4 ...
  Waiting in thread 1 ...
  thread 1: 11706.7 op/sec in 8.54 sec
  thread 2: 11674 op/sec in 8.57 sec
  thread 3: 11584.5 op/sec in 8.63 sec
  thread 4: 12096.5 op/sec in 8.27 sec
  thread 5: 11876.3 op/sec in 8.42 sec
  Total for CPU: 58938.1 op/sec
