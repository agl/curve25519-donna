Derived from https://github.com/agl/curve25519-donna

This project provides a method to test the performance of Curve25519 on the entire CPU, as opposed to a single thread, approximating the performance of a fully loaded server.

To run:
  make speed-curve25519-donna-c64-threaded && ./speed-curve25519-donna-c64-threaded

Output:
  Will use 4 threads
  Waiting in thread 2 ...
  Waiting in thread 1 ...
  Waiting in thread 4 ...
  Waiting in thread 3 ...
  thread 1: 14954.1 op/sec in 6.69 sec
  thread 2: 14645.4 op/sec in 6.83 sec
  thread 3: 14278.8 op/sec in 7.00 sec
  thread 4: 14628.6 op/sec in 6.84 sec
  Total for CPU: 58506.9 op/sec
